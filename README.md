## Objective:

Develope a TMDB Content-Based Movie Recommender System utilizing various tools and techniques. The primary objective of this project was to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their input, enhancing their movie-watching experience.

## Steps and Methods Used:

Obtained Datasets: Downloaded two distinct datasets from Kaggle - Movies and Credits.

Data Integration: Merged these datasets using pandas, utilizing the title column as the common key.

Data Cleaning: Unnecessary columns such as budget, homepage, and more were removed to streamline the dataset.

Handling Missing Values: Rows with null values in the overview feature were removed, ensuring data quality.

Genre and Keyword Extraction: Functions were created to extract genres and keywords from respective columns.

Actor and Director Extraction: Similar functions were used to extract actor and director names.

Textual Data Preprocessing: Overview, genres, keywords, cast, and director columns were processed for better analysis.

Feature Engineering: Concatenated the preprocessed columns to create a single "tags" feature.

TF-IDF Vectorization: The tags column was transformed into a numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization.

Cosine Similarity: Calculated cosine similarity scores to measure content similarity.

User-Friendly Interface: Developed a user interface using Streamlit to input user preferences and provide movie recommendations.

Web Scraping: Utilized the TMDB API to fetch movie posters for display.

Model Deployment: Saved essential objects as pickle files for deployment and hosted the recommender system on Streamlit Cloud.

## Challanges Faced:

The biggest challange was to add the similarity file to Github repository to deploy the model on Streamlit cloud due to its large size of 187mb. Also tried the same using LFS using command line, but still facing an issue due to Github LFS object memory limit. In order to solve the issue, reduced the size of the dataset by removing half of the total records as it was the only possible way to achieve the goal.

## Business Impact:

The implementation of this Content-Based Movie Recommender System has had a significant positive impact on the movie-watching experience and the bottom line:

Enhanced User Experience: Users can now receive personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences, leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement.

Increased User Retention: By offering tailored content suggestions, the system encourages users to stay on the platform, resulting in improved user retention rates.

Revenue Generation: Higher user engagement and longer session durations can potentially lead to increased revenue through advertising and premium subscriptions.

Cost Savings: The system's deployment has streamlined content discovery, reducing the need for costly manual curation and recommendation efforts.

Data-Driven Insights: The project provided insights into user preferences and the popularity of different genres and keywords, enabling data-driven decision-making for content acquisition and production.

## In summary, this TMDB Content-Based Movie Recommender System has not only improved user satisfaction but also demonstrated its potential to drive business growth and efficiency, making it a valuable addition to the platform.
